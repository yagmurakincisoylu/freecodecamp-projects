                <p>Nicola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known
                    for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system</p>

                <h2 class="tribute-title">Here's a time line of Nicola Tesla's life:</h2>
                <ul class="tribute-list">
                    <li><b>1859</b> - His birth records show he was born on July 28th. Tesla attended his early education in
                        1861 in
                        Smiljan, where he acquired various skills including arithmetic and he also mastered the German Language.
                        The
                        following year, Nikola Tesla moved to a place known as Gospic.</li>
                    <li><b>1870</b> - Nikola Tesla moved to a place known as Karlovac to complete his high school. Three years
                        later, he went back to Smiljan and shortly after his arrival; he contracted cholera. He was in hospital
                        for
                        close to one year, and he faced near-death circumstances.</li>
                    <li><b>1875</b> - Tesla enrolled to a Polytechnic based on a military scholarship. </li>
                    <li><b>1880</b> -
                        Teslaâ€™s uncle collected money to help him relocate to Prague to finish his studies. He arrived late to
                        enroll for classes, and his lack of competence in Greek and Czech meant that he did not qualify for the
                        classes he wanted to take. Instead, he took up classes in Philosophy at the university, though he did
                        not
                        receive grades for the courses.</li>
                    <li><b>1881</b> - He moved to Budapest in Hungary, to work for a telegraph company. Upon arriving, he
                        noticed
                        that the Budapest Telephone Exchange company was not in operation, so he worked at draftsman in another
                        company. A few months later, the BTS Company was in operation, and he was given the position of chief
                        electrical engineer.</li>
                    <li><b>1882</b> - He found another job in Paris with a company referred to as the Continental Edison
                        Company. He
                        began working in a new industry by installing indoor lighting resources. Following this, Tesla moved to
                        New
                        York in the USA. In 1884, one of his managers from Paris was relocated to the US to manage a company
                        where
                        he worked. During, this time, Tesla started a manufacturing division that was found in New York and
                        sought
                        for Tesla to be relocated to the country as well. In the same year, Tesla was relocated to the USA and
                        started working immediately.</li>
                    <li><b>1885</b> - In March 1885, he met with an attorney known as Lemuel Serrel, to help in the submission
                        of
                        various patents.</li>
                    <li><b>1887</b> - In 1887, Tesla came up with an induction motor that was operated by alternating current, a
                        form of power that was becoming common in Europe and the USA. This type of power provided various
                        benefits,
                        especially in long-distance power transmission. </li>
                    <li><b>1890</b> - After 1890, Tesla researched various approaches to transmitting power by inductive and
                        capacitive coupling. This was through the use of AC voltages that were produced by his famous `Tesla
                        coil.`
                    </li>
                    <li><b>1891</b> - In mid 1891, at the age of 35, he became a naturalized citizen of the US. In the same
                        year, he
                        also patented his famous Tesla Coil.</li>
                    <li><b>1943</b> - In early 1943, at age 86, Tesla died in a Hotel Room in New York.</li>
