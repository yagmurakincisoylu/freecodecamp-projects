            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
                written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside
                HTML and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
                This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification
                of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant
                CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable
                the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
                formatting.</p>
        </section>
    
        <section class="main-section" id="Syntax">
            <header>Syntax</header>
            <p>CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style
                properties.</p>
            <p>A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a
                declaration block.</p>
        </section>
    
        <section class="main-section" id="Selector">
            <header>Selector</header>
            <p>In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the
                markup itself.</p>
            <p>Selectors may apply to the following:</0>
            <ul class="main-list">
                <li>all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers <code>h2</code></li>
                <li>elements specified by attribute, in particular:</li>
                <ul class="sub-main-list">
                    <li><i>id:</i> an identifier unique within the document, identified with a hash prefix e.g.
                        <code>#id</code></li>
                    <li><i>id:</i> an identifier unique within the document, identified with a hash prefix e.g.
                        <code>#id</code></li>
                    <li><i>class:</i> an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, identified with a
                        period prefix e.g. <code>.classname</code></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and
                underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only be applied to a
                single element.</p>
            <p>Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in
                the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is <code>:hover</code>, which identifies
                content only when the user "points to" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It
                is appended to a selector as in <code>a:hover</code> or <code>#elementid:hover</code>. A pseudo-class
                classifies document elements, such as <code>:link</code> or <code>:visited</code>, whereas a pseudo-element
                makes a selection that may consist of partial elements, such as <code>::first-line</code> or
                <code>::first-letter</code>.</p>
        </section>
    
        <section class="main-section" id="Declaration_Block">
            <header>Declaration Block</header>
            <p>A declaration block consists of a list of declarations in braces. Each declaration itself consists of a
                property, a colon (<code>:</code>), and a value. If there are multiple declarations in a block, a semi-colon
                (<code>;</code>) must be inserted to separate each declaration. An optional semi-colon after the last (or
                single) declaration may be used.</p>
        </section>
    
        <section class="main-section" id="Length_Units">
            <header>Length Units</header>
            <p>Non-zero numeric values representing linear measures must include a length unit, which is either an
                alphabetic code or abbreviation, as in <code>200px</code> or <code>50vw</code>; or a percentage sign, as in
                <code>80%</code>. Some units – <code>cm</code> (centimetre); <code>in</code> (inch); <code>mm</code>
                (millimetre); <code>pc</code> (pica); and <code>pt</code> (point) – are absolute, which means that the
                rendered dimension does not depend upon the structure of the page; others – <code>em</code> (em);
                <code>ex</code> (ex) and <code>px</code> (pixel) – are relative, which means that factors such as the font
                size of a parent element can affect the rendered measurement. These eight units were a feature of CSS 1 and
                retained in all subsequent revisions. The proposed CSS Values and Units Module Level 3 will, if adopted as a
                W3C Recommendation, provide seven further length units: <code>ch</code>; <code>Q</code>; <code>rem</code>;
                <code>vh</code>; <code>vmax</code>; <code>vmin</code>; and <code>vw</code>.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Use">
            <header>Use</header>
            <p>Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup. All
                font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described, often
                repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style
                sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.</p>
        </section>
    
        <section class="main-section" id="Sources">
            <header>Sources</header>
            <p>CSS information can be provided from various sources. These sources can be the web browser, the user, and the
                author. The information from the author can be further classified into inline, media type, importance,
                selector specificity, rule order, inheritance, and property definition. CSS style information can be in a
                separate document, or it can be embedded into an HTML document. Multiple style sheets can be imported.
                Different styles can be applied depending on the output device being used; for example, the screen version
                can be quite different from the printed version, so that authors can tailor the presentation appropriately
                for each medium.</p>
        </section>
    
        <section class="main-section" id="Specificity">
            <header>Specificity</header>
            <p>Specificity refers to the relative weights of various rules.[16] It determines which styles apply to an
                element when more than one rule could apply. Based on specification, a simple selector (e.g. H1) has a
                specificity of 1, class selectors have a specificity of 1,0, and ID selectors a specificity of 1,0,0.
                Because the specificity values do not carry over as in the decimal system, commas are used to separate the
                "digits"[17] (a CSS rule having 11 elements and 11 classes would have a specificity of 11,11, not 121).</p>
            <table>
                <caption>Thus the following rules selectors result in the indicated specificity:</caption>

        <section class="main-section" id="Inheritance">
            <header>Inheritance</header>
            <p>Inheritance is a key feature in CSS; it relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate.
                Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to
                its descendants. Inheritance relies on the document tree, which is the hierarchy of XHTML elements in a page
                based on nesting. Descendant elements may inherit CSS property values from any ancestor element enclosing
                them. In general, descendant elements inherit text-related properties, but their box-related properties are
                not inherited. Properties that can be inherited are color, font, letter-spacing, line-height, list-style,
                text-align, text-indent, text-transform, visibility, white-space and word-spacing. Properties that cannot be
                inherited are background, border, display, float and clear, height, and width, margin, min- and max-height
                and -width, outline, overflow, padding, position, text-decoration, vertical-align and z-index.</p>
            <p>Given the following style sheet:</p>
            <pre>
          <code>
    h1 {
      color: pink;
    }
    
    p {
      color: red;
      text-align: center;
    }
          </code>
        </pre>
        </section>
    
        <section class="main-section" id="Whitespace">
            <header>Whitespace</header>
            <p>Whitespace between properties and selectors is ignored. This code snippet:</p>
            <code class="code-box">  body{overflow:hidden;background:#000000;background-image:url(images/bg.gif);background-repeat:no-repeat;background-position:left top;}
          </code>
            <p>is functionally equivalent to this one:</p>
            <pre>
          <code>
    body {
       overflow: hidden;
       background-color: #000000;
       background-image: url(images/bg.gif);
       background-repeat: no-repeat;
       background-position: left top;
    }
          </code>
        </pre>
        </section>
    
        <section class="main-section" id="History">
            <header>History</header>
            <p>CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim
                Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and
                discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS
                Recommendation (CSS1) being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he
                became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.</p>
            <p>Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language
                (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web. One requirement for a web
                style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing
                style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style
                be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.</p>
